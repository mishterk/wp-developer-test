A minimalist boilerplate for WordPress theme development using [Laravel Mix](https://laravel.com/docs/5.8/mix).

## Getting started:

1. Clone into an empty theme directory
1. `cd` into your new theme directory
1. Run `npm install`
1. Open up the `webpack.mix.js` file and replace `http://localhost/` with your local development hostname
   - This will allow you to use live reload/injection while working on your CSS/JS
  
### To Start Development

Run `npm run dev`

Assets will be compiled and BrowserSync will proxy the dev host allowing you to work while seeing your CSS and JS 
changes appear on the site as they are recompiled.  

### To Prepare Assets for Deployment

Run `npm run prod`

This will prepare versioned assets and sourcemaps for your CSS and JS files. 

## Versioned Assets

Versioned assets will appear in a `build` directory alongside a manifest file which is used while 
[enqueuing scripts and styles](https://github.com/mishterk/wp-laravel-mix-theme-boilerplate/blob/master/includes/scripts-and-styles.php).
This saves you the need to adjust version parameters on your assets and makes it possible to remove parameters on 
asset URLs without losing the ability to force those assets to update in browsers.
